summary: Learn how to quickly type em and en dashes on Windows using a simple AutoHotkey script
---

Typing special characters like the em dash (—) and en dash (–) can be a bit clunky on standard keyboards. You often have to remember specific Alt codes or rely on software auto-correction. I'm using simple shortcuts in the AutoHotkey script to map the en dash and em dash to the number pad.

## What are Em and En dashes?

Before we dive into the script, let's quickly recap what these dashes are for:

*   **En Dash (–):** Slightly wider than a hyphen, it's primarily used to indicate ranges (e.g., "pages 10–15", "Monday–Friday") or connections.
*   **Em Dash (—):** The width of the letter 'M', it's often used to indicate a pause or break in thought—much like this—or to set off parenthetical statements.

## AutoHotkey to the Rescue

[AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is a fantastic free scripting language for Windows that allows you to automate tasks, remap keys, and create custom shortcuts.

Here's a simple script I use to map the en dash and em dash to convenient shortcuts using the number pad:

```autohotkey
; En dash: Alt + Numpad Minus
!NumpadSub::
Send, {ASC 0150} ; Sends the Alt code for en dash
return

; Em dash: Alt + Numpad Plus
!NumpadAdd::
Send, {ASC 0151} ; Sends the Alt code for em dash
return
```

## How it Works

*   `!NumpadSub::` and `!NumpadAdd::`: These lines define the hotkeys. `!` represents the Alt key, `NumpadSub` is the minus key on the numeric keypad, and `NumpadAdd` is the plus key.
*   `Send, {ASC 0150}` / `Send, {ASC 0151}`: This command tells AutoHotkey to simulate typing the Alt codes for the en dash (Alt+0150) and em dash (Alt+0151), respectively.
*   `return`: This indicates the end of the hotkey's action.

With this script running, you can simply press `Alt + Numpad Minus` for an en dash (–) and `Alt + Numpad Plus` for an em dash (—) in any application. It's a small tweak, but it makes typing these useful punctuation marks significantly faster!
