One of the feature of the C# allows to swap values via deconstruction (without using temporary variable). It was introduced while ago (C# 7.0), but I oversaw it. It's a nice feature that allows to swap values in a very elegant way.

So, the before code is:

```csharp
var temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;
```

And now, we can do it in a more elegant way + with no variable declaration:

```csharp
(a, b) = (b, a);
```

Whoa! That's cool! ðŸ˜Ž

But wait, do we have a temporary variable allocated? Let's dig into it deeper.

By looking into the decompiled code[^1], we can see that there is the temporary variable, but it's not allocated (it is stored in the stack):

```csharp
int b = P_0.b;
int num = (P_0.b = P_0.a);
P_0.a = b;
```

Now, let's see if the JIT assembly code differs from the non-tuple-deconstruction code:

The full code is:

```csharp
int a, b;

void tuple_deconstruction() => (a, b) = (b, a);

void old_way()
{
    int num = a;
    a = b;
    b = num;
}
```

The JIT code is:

```asm
C.tuple_deconstruction()
    L0000: mov eax, [rcx+0xc]
    L0003: mov edx, [rcx+8]
    L0006: mov [rcx+8], eax
    L0009: mov [rcx+0xc], edx
    L000c: ret

C.old_way()
    L0000: mov eax, [rcx+8]
    L0003: mov edx, [rcx+0xc]
    L0006: mov [rcx+8], edx
    L0009: mov [rcx+0xc], eax
    L000c: ret
```

So, it's the same - swapping is done in a different order, but the logic is the same.
