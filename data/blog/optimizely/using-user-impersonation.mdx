  Learn the correct way to execute code as a specific Optimizely user using IUserImpersonation.
---

A common need is to execute actions as a specific user, especially for tasks requiring permissions. When running code in Optimizely background tasks (like scheduled jobs), you often lose the user context available via `HttpContext.Current`, so in this case you need to use `IUserImpersonation`.

Developers might have tried creating a principal manually:

```csharp
PrincipalInfo.CurrentPrincipal = new GenericPrincipal(
    new GenericIdentity("SomeUser"),
    new[] { "Administrators" }
);
```

This approach often fails because Optimizely's security relies on specific providers. A manually created principal might lack the necessary roles or claims recognized by all Optimizely services (e.g., CMS vs. Commerce), leading to "Access Denied" errors, for example:

> Access was denied to content 65469842123\_\_CatalogContent. The required access level was "Administrator"

## The correct way: IUserImpersonation

Optimizely provides `IUserImpersonation` functionality to create a principal correctly within its security context.

```csharp
public interface IUserImpersonation
{
  Task<IPrincipal> CreatePrincipalAsync(string userName);
}
```

It does the following:

> Create a principal based on a user name and add roles from the current EPiServer.Security.SecurityEntityProvider
>
> Remark: This is no validation done, if the user does not exist it will be created without roles.

## How to Use It

Inject `IUserImpersonation` and `IPrincipalAccessor` where needed (e.g., in your scheduled job class).

```csharp
// Inject services IUserImpersonation userImpersonation, IPrincipalAccessor principalAccessor

// 1. Specify the username. Use an EXISTING user to ensure roles are loaded.
string targetUsername = "newAdmin"; // Or another Optimizely user

// 2. Create the principal
var principal = await userImpersonation.CreatePrincipalAsync(targetUsername);

// 3. Set it as the current principal for the scope
principalAccessor.Principal = principal;

// Now, code executed here runs as 'targetUsername'
// Example: _contentRepository.Save(...)
```

**Key Points:**

1.  **Username:** While the call works even for non-existent usernames, it will only assign roles if the user _exists_ in Optimizely. Use an existing user with the required permissions.
2.  **Set Principal:** You _must_ set the `principalAccessor.Principal` property for the impersonation to take effect.
3.  **Scope:** The impersonation applies within the scope where `principalAccessor.Principal` is set. Consider using `try...finally` to restore the original principal if necessary, although often not required for simple background jobs.

By using `IUserImpersonation` and `IPrincipalAccessor`, you ensure that your code execute with the correct user context and permissions recognized by the entire Optimizely platform.
