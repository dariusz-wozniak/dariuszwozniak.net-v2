summary: Using thread to resolve the current language in Optimizely is not recommended. Here is why and how to fix it.
---

Using a thread to resolve the current language in Optimizely is not recommended. If you check the `Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture` locally, it might yield the specific culture (e.g. en-US), but it might not work as expected in the DXP (Digital Experience Platform) environment.

For the instance, the thread might be invariant and yield the "iv" code instead of the actual culture code. In that case, data you might expect might not be loaded.

The invariant culture is a culture that is culture-independent. It is described as the following:

* LCID: 127
* KeyboardLayoutId: 127
* DisplayName Invariant Language (Invariant Country)
* NativeName: Invariant Language (Invariant Country)
* TwoLetterISOLanguageName: iv
* ThreeLetterISOLanguageName: ivl
* ThreeLetterWindowsLanguageName: IVL

Solution? There are many. The most obvious that comes to mind are:

* Set a cookie with the language code.
* Resolve the language from the URL.
* Use the `ContentLanguage.PreferredCulture` property.
    * It uses the `IContentLanguageAccessor.Language` under the hood which uses the `_cache["EPiServer:ContentLanguage"]` to store the language.
