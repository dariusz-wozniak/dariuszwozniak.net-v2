# How to get content from the code

In Optimizely, in order to get a reference from a product/variant code (that is a string), you may use the `ReferenceConverter` class:

```csharp
string code = "SKU123";
var reference = _referenceConverter.GetContentLink(code);
```

Note:

* `ReferenceConverter` is a class with no interface.
* Always check if Content Reference is not null (`ContentReference.IsNullOrEmpty`).
* Results are internally cached.

# Behind the scenes

Basically, the ReferenceConverter runs the stored procedure that make a simple lookup in the database. Internally, it calls the `CatalogIdentityResolver.GetIds` method which might call one of the following stored procedures:

* `ecf_GetCatalogEntryIdsByCodes`
* `ecf_GetCatalogNodeIdsByCodes`
