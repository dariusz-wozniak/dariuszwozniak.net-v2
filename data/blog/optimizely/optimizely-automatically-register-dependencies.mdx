summary: How to automatically register dependencies in Optimizely? (also in any other project that uses Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection library)
---

In Optimizely, dependency injection is based on the `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` library by default.

You may register dependencies:
- explicitly
    - can be done in either `Startup.cs` or `InitializableModule`
    - example of code: `context.Services.AddTransient<ISomeService, SomeService>()`
- implicitly
    - by applying the `[ServiceConfiguration]` attribute

If you want to automate the registration of dependencies, you can use the [Scrutor](https://github.com/khellang/Scrutor) library. The library scans assemblies and automatically registers dependencies based on the attributes applied to the classes.

The code I'm using for the Optimizely project lands at the end of the `ConfigureServices` method in `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
services.Scan(x => x.FromAssembliesOf(typeof(Startup))
                    .AddClasses(filter => filter.Where(type => !typeof(Attribute).IsAssignableFrom(type)))
                    .UsingRegistrationStrategy(RegistrationStrategy.Skip)
                    .AsImplementedInterfaces());
```

Please note that `RegistrationStrategy.Skip` makes previous registrations take precedence over the ones made by the Scrutor.

Scrutor is, of course, not only limited to Optimizely. You can use it in any .NET project (which I recommend).
