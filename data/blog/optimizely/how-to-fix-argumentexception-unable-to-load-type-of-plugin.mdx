# Introduction

Recently, I have encountered the following error: System.ArgumentException: Unable to load type (IPlugin type). This was happening in two actions:

- On saving contact via code: `CustomerContact.SaveChanges()`, or,
- Saving contact in the Commerce UI.

The difficulty was that the error was not very descriptive and didn't occur on each save operation.

The UI was saying:

> Unable to load type ContactUpdatedPlugin

While the code has the following error:

> System.ArgumentException: Unable to load type Foo.Bar.ContactUpdatedPlugin

With the call stack:

```text

   at Mediachase.Commerce.Customers.CustomerContact.SaveChanges()
   at Foo.Bar.CustomContact.SaveChanges()
```

# Solution

The error happened because the plugin's namespace was changed, and the plugin's registration had a fixed definition of the plugin namespace.

So, to fix the error, we may update the plugin's registration. However, the better way is to add the `typeof` to the plugin registration in the way like:

```csharp
services.Configure<BusinessManagerOptions>(options =>
{
    options.Plugins.Add(new RequestPlugin
    {
        MetaClass = "Contact",
        Method = "Update",
        EventStage = EventPipeLineStage.PostMainOperation,
        TypeName = $"{typeof(ContactUpdatedPlugin).FullName}, Foobar"
    });
});
```
