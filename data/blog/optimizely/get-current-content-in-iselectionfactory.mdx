summary: Recently I struggled with getting data for the current content in the ISelectionFactory context. Here is the solution.
---

# Introduction

Selection factories are used to populate dropdowns in the Episerver UI. It is used when either `SelectOne` or `SelectMany` attributes are used on a property.

The selection factory is a class that implements `ISelectionFactory` interface. It has a following signature:

```csharp
public interface ISelectionFactory
{
    IEnumerable<ISelectItem> GetSelections(ExtendedMetadata metadata);
}
```

The problem is that there is no simple way to get the current object that is being edited. The `ExtendedMetadata` object does not contain any information about the current object. The `FindOwnerContent()` returns null.

# Solution

The solution is to get the content ID from the HTTP request header. It is stored in the `x-epicurrentcontentcontext` header. The following code snippet shows how to get the content ID:

```csharp
public virtual IEnumerable<ISelectItem> GetSelections(ExtendedMetadata metadata)
{
    var currentContext = _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext?.Request.Headers["x-epicurrentcontentcontext"];
    if (currentContext is null) return Enumerable.Empty<ISelectItem>();

    var elementId = currentContext.Value.FirstOrDefault();
    if (elementId is null) return Enumerable.Empty<ISelectItem>();

    var get = _contentLoader.TryGet(new ContentReference(elementId), out ElementBlockBase? currentBlock);

    // remaining logic here
}
```

Where `_httpContextAccessor` is an instance of `IHttpContextAccessor` that is injected into the constructor.

# Conclusion

This is a simple solution to a problem that I struggled with for a while. The remarks are:

There's only one Google hit for the `x-epicurrentcontentcontext` header. It is a [forum post](https://world.optimizely.com/forum/developer-forum/CMS/Thread-Container/2016/1/current-content-for-propertylist-item-selection-factory/) from 2016. Thus, it would be nice that such scenario would be documented.

Please note the solution won't be working in the quick edit dialog. As per above forum post:

> This however will not work in the quick-edit dialog, the x-epicurrentcontentcontext header will there instead contain whatever content you were on before opening the quick-edit dialog.
