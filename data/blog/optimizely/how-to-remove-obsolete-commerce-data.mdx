By default, Optimizely code does not remove properties from the database when you remove them from the code. This article describes how to remove obsolete Commerce data and introduces the Opti Addons project.

# Introduction

When we develop a project, we often add new properties to the classes. However, when we remove them, the properties are not removed from the database. This can lead to a situation where the database contains obsolete data that is no longer used in the code. This article describes how to remove that data.

Historically, it was possible in the old Episerver Commerce, but that feature is gone as for now.

# Automatically

I just created the [Opti.Addons](https://github.com/Opti-Addons) project which contains small handy tools for Optimizely. The first tool is called [DeleteMissingCommercePropertiesScheduledJob](https://github.com/Opti-Addons/Opti.Addons.DeleteMissingCommercePropertiesScheduledJob) and is basically a scheduled job that removes obsolete properties from the database.
