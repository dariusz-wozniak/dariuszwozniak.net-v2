Recently I've been working on a project that requires parsing temporal expressions. I've created a library that provides a comprehensive EBNF grammar for representing fuzzy, uncertain, and complex temporal expressions.

That is the project that I've been working on for... years. It was bit a bit, gathering requirements, data, thoughts, that would make the searchable and parsable fuzzy dates grammar. With the advancement of vibe cod... er, AI, I was able to complete the whole grammar in a few days.

# Fuzzy Dates Library

The Fuzzy Dates library provides a comprehensive EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) grammar for representing fuzzy, uncertain, and complex temporal expressions. This standardized approach to expressing dates and times is particularly valuable in scenarios where precision is not absolute or when dealing with historical, archaeological, scientific, etc. temporal data.

## Why Fuzzy Dates?

Let's tackle a few Wikipedia examples (really random articles):

* John of Brienne: c. 1170 – 19–23 March 1237 (uncertain birth year, unknown birth month and day, approximate death date)
   * ''Most 13th-century sources suggest that John died between 19 and 23 March 1237''
* Pope Gregory IX: 1145 – 22 August 1241 (unknown birth month and day)
* Pope Innocent II: died 24 September 1143 (unknown birth date)
* 2025 24 Hours of Le Mans Test Day: 10:00 to 13:00 CEST (UTC+02:00) (time range with timezone)

Traditional date-format (including ISO 8601) is not enough to express these dates, uncertainities, and complex temporal expressions. And thus, the library was born.

## Key Features

The library supports a wide range of temporal expressions:

* Standard Dates — e.g. `1990-05-01`
* Approximate Dates (`~`) — e.g. `~1990`
* Partial Dates (`?`) — e.g. `2025-04-?`
* Time-Only Expressions (`T`) — e.g. `T12:00:00`
* Time-Only Expressions With High Precision — e.g. `2023-11-20T23:59:59.123456789`
* Seasons (`Season-YYYY`) — e.g. `Autumn-2023`
* Periodic Dates (`D`, `W`, `Q`, `H`) — e.g. `D12-2022`
* Centuries (`C`) - e.g. `19C`
* Decades (`YYYYs`) - e.g. `1970s`
* Temporal Qualifiers (`Early-`, `Mid-`, `Late-`) — e.g. `Early-2020`
* Notes and Annotations — e.g. `1985-12-17T08:45:00+02:00#birth of author`
* Geo-Temporal Qualifiers — e.g. `2023-06-15@Tokyo`
* Geo-Temporal Qualifiers With Coordinates — e.g. `2023-06-15T12:00:00@geo:50.061389,19.937222`
* Historical Style Notes — e.g. `1700-03-20(os)`
* Calendar Systems — e.g. `1700-03-20(julian)`
* Ranges and Open-ended Ranges — e.g. `2000..2010`
* Multiple Choices — e.g. `1980-01-01..1981-12-31|1990-01..1992-06`
* Choices/Ranges — e.g. `2012-12-[1..3]`
* Uncertainty Expressions — e.g. `2014(±2y)`
* Nested Uncertainty — e.g. `~2023(±1y)(±0.5Q)`
* Ordinal Day-of-Week Expressions — e.g. `1º-Mon-2022`
* Weighted Date Part Choices — e.g. `2020-[03*20%-04*80%]`
* Temporal Integer Choices — e.g. `2023-[03..05]`
* Timezone Handling — e.g. `2024-01-01T00:00:00[America/New_York]`
* Timezone Shifts — e.g. `2024-01-01T00:00:00[EST→EDT]`
* Number Separators — e.g. `1_000_000`
* Probability Distributions — e.g. `2023~normal(μ=2023,σ=2)`

## Example Usages

## Getting Started

The repository defines the lexical grammar, that can be used to parse the temporal expressions. The main practical usage is to have a precise and flexible grammar to parse these expressions.

The parser can be integrated with the SPARQL query language, to query the temporal expressions:

Examples:

1. **Custom Functions**
   - `fuzzy:matches(date, pattern)` - Matches a date against a fuzzy date pattern
   - `fuzzy:overlaps(date1, date2)` - Checks if two fuzzy dates overlap
   - `fuzzy:contains(date, subdate)` - Checks if one fuzzy date contains another

2. **Temporal Reasoning**
   ```sparql
   # Find events that occurred during a specific period
   SELECT ?event
   WHERE {
     ?event fuzzy:date ?date .
     FILTER(fuzzy:overlaps(?date, "2020-2025"))
   }
   ```

3. **Uncertainty Handling**
   ```sparql
   # Find events with specific uncertainty levels
   SELECT ?event
   WHERE {
     ?event fuzzy:date ?date .
     FILTER(fuzzy:matches(?date, "2020(±1y)"))
   }
   ```

4. **Complex Temporal Queries**
   ```sparql
   # Find events in a specific season with uncertainty
   SELECT ?event
   WHERE {
     ?event fuzzy:date ?date .
     FILTER(fuzzy:matches(?date, "Summer-2023(±1m)"))
   }
   ```

## What now?

I had a lot of fun working on this project. I've learned a lot about the temporal expressions, the grammar, and the its practical usage. I've built a simple parser and a few tests. I'm leaving the project open as it has a lot of potentials for grammar improvements (see ideas section under the project repository readme).
