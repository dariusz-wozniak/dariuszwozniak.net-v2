*Cześć*, I’m Darek! (IPA: [darɛk vɔʑɲak])

Well... I have started my programming at my youth where tried to code some simple apps and video games in Turbo Pascal and C on Windows 98. Now, I am passionate about programming world in every bit—From low-level instructions to the techniques, methodologies, and philosophies of its creation.[^1] I see myself as a [software craftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship). In addition to this, I’ve written a [best-selling book on Test-Driven Development](https://helion.pl/ksiazki/tdd-techniki-programowania-sterowanego-testami-dariusz-wozniak,tddppr.htm), published by Helion.

As of my career, I've been handling software for different variety of clients: from small startup companies to large corporations. Recently I've been working in the e-Commerce field, developing B2B/B2C solutions; my clients were, among others—Toyota, Skanska, Kanthal, Lindex, Dorothee Schumacher, Sennheiser, and Neumann. Before, I've been working in different kind of industries, such as banking (Saxo Bank) and travel (Sabre).

Apart from programming itself, I love to travel, especially to lesser-known and uncrowded corners (of my country as well). I have visited over 50 countries, including partially recognized republics.[^2] My preferred modes of travel are hitchhiking, cycling, and train journeys. I believe in savoring each moment of my travels, often returning to places that have left a mark on me. After all, it’s not about ticking off a list or clocking kilometers, it's also about the slow experience of a place and a moment.[^3]

Another passion that fuels my creativity is street photography. I'm sharing my encounters with the world on my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/darek_wozn).

In my leisure time, I engage in various activities, such as cycling, running, hiking, squash [etc.] I believe in making the most of every moment.
