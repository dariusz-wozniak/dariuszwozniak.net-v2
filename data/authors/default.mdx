*Cześć*, I’m Darek! (IPA: [darɛk vɔʑɲak])

I am passionate about programming and the techniques, methodologies, and philosophies of its creation (agile, lean and kanban). I see myself as a [software craftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship), honing my skills with each line of code. In addition to this, I’ve penned a [best-selling book on Test-Driven Development](https://helion.pl/ksiazki/tdd-techniki-programowania-sterowanego-testami-dariusz-wozniak,tddppr.htm), published by Helion.

Apart from programming itself, I love to travel, especially to lesser-known and uncrowded corners of our country as well. I have visited over 50 countries, including partially recognized republics — Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, Northern Cyprus, and Kosovo. My preferred modes of travel are hitchhiking, cycling, and train journeys. I believe in savoring each moment of my travels, often returning to places that have left a mark on me. After all, it’s not about ticking off a list or clocking kilometres, it's also about slow experience of a place and a moment.

Another passion that fuels my creativity is street photography. I'm sharing my encounters with the world on my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/darek_wozn).

In my leisure time, I engage in a variety of activities, such as cycling, running, hiking, squash [etc.] I believe in making the most of every moment.
